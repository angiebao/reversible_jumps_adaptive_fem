%% Function Definition
function polynomials = get_fem_basis(n)
    % Function Name: get the polynomial basis of degree n in a sqaure
    %                   [-1, 1] X [-1, 1]
    % Input: n - the degree of polynomials
    % Output: polynomials - a matrix of polynomials; each row is a separate
    %           polynomial; the first polynomial corresponds to the
    %           polynomial associated with node (-1, -1) and polynomials are
    %           ordered in a clockwise order; for example, for n =
    %           1, the four polynomials are for (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, 1)
    %           and (1, -1) in order; for n = 2, the eight polynomials are
    %           for (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0), (1,
    %           -1), (0, -1) respectively
